/**
    The GL state this plugin changes, captured so it can be put back.

    Lifted from vectrix, which lifted it from `resolume-scopes`' `Scopes.cpp`
    unchanged, because the requirement is unchanged: FFGL requires the context to be returned in a
    default state, and Resolume renders the rest of the composition with
    whatever it finds. A plugin that leaves additive blending on is a plugin
    that makes the *next* effect in the chain look broken, which is where the
    bug report will come from.

    `ScopedGLState` is the only addition. The renderer has several early
    returns -- a buffer that would not allocate, a shader that did not compile,
    a sample count of one -- and every one of them has to put the state back.
    Doing that by hand at each `return` is how one of them ends up missing it.
