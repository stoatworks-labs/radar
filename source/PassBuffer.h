/**
    An off-screen buffer for one stage of the chain.

    Three things on top of the SDK's FFGLFBO.

    **It reallocates only when it has to.** Ensure() is called every frame and
    is a no-op in the overwhelming majority of them.

    **It actually frees its colour texture.** `ffglex::FFGLFBO::Release()`
    deletes the framebuffer and the depth renderbuffer, then tests
    `depthBufferID` a second time where it plainly meant `colorTextureID` --
    so the colour texture is leaked on every release (SDK b1afaf9,
    `FFGLFBO.cpp`). `Destroy()` deletes it first. It matters here: the whole
    simulation reallocates when Detail changes or the raster does.

    **It owns its filtering and its wrap**, because this plugin's buffers want
    different answers: the Fourier buffers are read texel-for-texel and must
    not be filtered; the surface is read between texels AND is periodic -- the
    simulated domain wraps, so a read past its edge must come back in at the
    other side, which is `GL_REPEAT` and nothing else.
