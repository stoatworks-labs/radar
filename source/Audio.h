/**
	The audio side: a spectrum in, a level and an onset out.

	Copied from millpond, which took rosette's cut of macroblock's analyser --
	the one that has been driven with real music through Resolume's FFT
	buffer. What Radar needs is the onset detector (each onset is a strobe, and
	in the source a new contact), including the primed first frame that keeps it
	from firing on a clip trigger. `ratest --prime` is the check that the
	priming works. It sums every bin with the same weight and never asks which
	frequency a bin is: nobody has measured Resolume's 64 bins (magnitude or
	power, window, linear or not), and nothing here depends on the answer.

	**Where the audio comes from.** FFGL has no audio path. What Resolume
	provides is a buffer parameter declared `FF_USAGE_FFT`, which the host
	fills with a 64-bin spectrum once per frame -- a *modulation* source at
	video rate, not a signal source, so the smallest interval this can
	resolve is a frame and a kick lands on the frame after the transient.

	**Normalised against its own recent peak**, so the same Audio Strobe means
	the same spoke on a quiet stem and a mastered track (the strobe's strength
	follows the latched kick). The cost is that a long loud passage reads as
	"1" throughout, because relative to the last few seconds it is.
